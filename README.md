# PredictingDiseases
This repository has four scripts that use machine learning to predict the likelihood of an individual in a test set being diagnosed with such diseases. Data sets were taken from Kaggle for Parkinson's, Cardiovascular, Breast Cancer, and Chronic Kidney Disease.  

All scripts were created with using Google Collab. Some of the data sets were too large thus requiring the use of importing from Google Drive.
